Marketing agency owners: What's your biggest client retention challenge?

I've talked to 50+ agency owners this month, and here's what I'm hearing:

❌ Clients expect constant innovation
❌ Competition from larger agencies  
❌ Pressure to show measurable ROI
❌ Limited service differentiation

Here's what the smart agencies are doing:
✅ Adding engagement campaigns to their offerings
✅ Using viral mechanics to amplify client results
✅ Charging premium rates for interactive marketing

We built a white-label platform that lets agencies offer raffle campaigns in 24 hours instead of 6 months.

Interested in seeing how this could work for your agency?
